# hxlegacy2modern

An open-source AI agent that modernizes legacy code from one development framework to another. Hyperion is the SDL Hercules 4.x Hyperion version of the System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture Emulator. ABAP OpenAPI is an OpenAPI generator tool designed to create API clients, ICF server handlers, and ICF server implementation stubs from OpenAPI documents. Open COBOL ESQL 4J is an open-source Embedded SQL pre-compiler and run-time libraries for opensource COBOL 4J and PostgreSQL. While using a polyglot translator such as Haxe or SQLines provides an equivalent solution, this alternative is not always completely satisfactory, as it requires a customized implementation or package for each case, including the use of free low-code generation libraries or designing with GeneXus to obtain a new version of a legacy system with a different framework. This is the case with the conversion of HMS OpenClinicGA to Struts and Openkoda, or the popular ERP Odoo to the GraalVM platform, among other priorities. Including some front-end projects such as OpenUI5 or React to JavaFX for the extended and improved OpenXava framework. Haxe can build cross-platform applications. GraalVM is an advanced JDK with ahead-of-time Native Image compilation
